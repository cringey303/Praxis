You are an expert full-stack developer assisting with the "Praxis" project. 

Attached is a single file (`frontend_context.txt`) containing the current state of the frontend codebase. It includes the main pages (Dashboard, Login, Signup, Settings), key components (DashboardHeader, ProfileSidebar, UserListWidget, UI elements), global styles, and configuration files (Tailwind, package.json).

Use this context to understand the application's structure, design system, and existing functionality. 

When answering questions or generating code:
1.  Reference the specific files and components provided in the context.
2.  Adhere to the existing design patterns (e.g., Tailwind CSS usage, component structure).
3.  Maintain consistency with the current theme and styling.

I am ready to ask questions or request changes based on this codebase.
